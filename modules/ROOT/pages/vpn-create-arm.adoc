== Prerequisites

Before creating a VPN, you must create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). See link:runtime-manager::virtual-private-cloud.adoc[Virtual Private Cloud] for more information. You should also ensure that the components of your external network are configured correctly.

When creating or configuring a VPN, you must provide the following information:

* *Remote IP address:* IP address of the device you are connecting to.
* *Pre-shared Key (PSK):* (Optional) Shared secret used by the network tunnel that connects Anypoint Platform and your network. This value will be auto-generated if you leave it blank.
* *Point-to-Point CIDR:* (Optional) IP range used by the network tunnel. You must configure a unique IP address range for each tunnel. This value will be auto-generated if you leave it blank.
* *Remote and Local Autonomous System Number (ASN)*: Specifies the collection of routing prefixes. You must configure both a remote and local ASN before creating a VPN. This is required only if you are using dynamic routing.
* *Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR)*: Specifies the routing address of your network. This is required only if you are using static routing.

== Create a VPN

. From the Anypoint Management Center, select *Runtime Manager*.
. Go to the environment where you want to create a VPN.
. Click the *VPN* tab, then click *Create VPN*.
. Enter a name for your VPN.
. Select a Virtual Private Cloud from the drop-down list.
. Enter the remote IP address used to connect to your VPN.
. Select the routing type you want to use for your VPN. +
Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) routing is recommended when possible.
[loweralpha]
.. To use BGP routing:
... Select *BGP Routing*.
... Enter the ASN corresponding to your backend under Remote ASN. The default value is 65001.
... Assign an ASN to the Mule VPC side under Local ASN. The default value is 64512.
.. To use static routing:
... Select *Static Routing*.
... Click *Add New Rule*.
... Enter a Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) address. For example: `10.0.0.0/8`
. Configure the tunnel used to connect between Anypoint Platform and your network.
+
You must configure two tunnels that connect between different endpoints. In the case of a custom configuration, you can use the same PSK value for both connections, but you must use different point-to-point CIDR ranges.
. Select the type of tunnel configuration for your VPN: +
.. *Automatic*: Automatically configures the required tunnels for your VPN using the default values.
.. *Custom*: Enables you to manually configure the tunnels used by your VPN.
... Enter a value for the PSK.
  The PSK must be between 8 and 64 characters in length and cannot start with zero (0). Allowed characters are alphanumeric characters, periods (.), and underscores (_).
... Enter the address range for the Point-To-Point CIDR. +
  The range of inside IP addresses for the VPN tunnel. You can specify a size /30 CIDR block from the 169.254.0.0/16 range. The CIDR block must be unique across all VPN connections. +
The following CIDR blocks are reserved and cannot be used:
----
169.254.0.0/30
169.254.1.0/30
169.254.2.0/30
169.254.3.0/30
169.254.4.0/30
169.254.5.0/30
169.254.169.252/30
----

. Click *Create VPN*.

[NOTE]
You cannot modify tunnel options after you create the VPN connection. To change the settings for an existing connection, you must delete the VPN connection and create a new one. 

== Result

After creating the VPN, it appears in the list of VPNs. Initially, the *Status* column displays PENDING and both VPN tunnels display DOWN. Once your VPN connection is successful, the status changes to AVAILABLE and UP.

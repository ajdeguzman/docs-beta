This topic describes how to create a Anypoint VPN using Runtime Manager.

== Prerequisites

Before creating a VPN, you must create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). See About Virtiual Private Cloud for more information. You should also ensure that the components of your external network are configured correctly. See link:runtime-manager::virtual-private-cloud.adoc[Virtual Private Cloud] for more information. You should also ensure that the components of your external network are configured correctly.

Additionally, you must provide the following when creating or configuring a VPN:

* *Remote IP address:* the IP address of the device you are connecting to.
* *Pre-shared Key (PSK):* the shared secret used by the network tunnel that connects between Anypoint Platform and your network (optional, will be auto-generated if left blank).
* *Point-to-Point CIDR:* the IP range used by the network tunnel. You must configure a unique IP address range for each tunnel (optional, will be auto-generated if left blank).
* *Remote and Local Autonomous System Number (ASN)*: specifies the collection of routing prefixes. You must configure both a remote and local ASN before creating a VPN. 
* *Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR)*: specifies the routing address of your network. This is required only if you are using static routing.

== Procedure

. From the Management Center, select Runtime Manager.
. Go to the environment where you want to create a VPN.
. Click the *VPN* tab, then click *Create VPN*.
. Enter a name for your VPN.
. Select a Virtual Private Cloud from the drop down list.
. Enter the remote IP address used to connect to your VPN.
. Select the routing type you want to use for your VPN.
+
We recommend that you use Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) routing when possible.
..To use BGP routing:
... Select BGP Routing.
... Enter the ASN corresponding to your backend under Remote ASN. The default value is 65001.
... Assign an ASN to the Mule VPC side under Local ASN. The default value is 64512.
..To use static routing:
... Select Static Routing.
... Click Add New Rule.
... Enter a Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) address. For example: + ---- 10.0.0.0/8 ----
. Configure the tunnel used to connect between Anypoint Platform and your network.
+
You must configure two tunnels that connect between different endpoints. In the case of a custom configuration, you can use the same PSK value for both connections, but you must use different Point-to-point CIDR ranges.
. Select the type of tunnel configuration for your VPN:
+
* Automatic: automatically configures the required tunnels for your VPN using the default values.
* Custom: enables you to manually configure the tunnels used by your VPN.
. Enter a value for the PSK.
. Enter the address range for the Point-To-Point CIDR. For example:
+
----
169.254.1.1/30
----
. Click Create VPN

== Result

After creating the VPN, it appears in the list of VPNs. Initially, the Status column displays a value of PENDING and both VPN tunnels display DOWN. If your VPN connection is successful, the values should be AVAILABLE and UP.

The Anypoint VPN feature enables you to create a secure connection to systems within your network that are hosted outside of Anypoint Platform. If required, you can create multiple VPNs to connect to different networks or different regions within a network.

[NOTE]
The number of VPNs you can create depends on the VPN capacity allocated to your account.

To create and maintain a secure connection with your external network, the Anypoint VPN provides the following features:

* Route-based access via 2-byte and 4-byte Autonomous System Numbers (ASN). This defines the routing policies used to connect to your network through the VPN.
* Reusable IP addresses.
* Tunnel configuration.

[NOTE]
Network Address Translation (NAT) is not supported.

== Supported IPsec Configurations

Anypoint VPN supports the IPsec configurations for encrypting data communications between Anypoint Platform and your network:

* IKE version 1
* AES 128 and 256-bit encryption
* SHA and SHA-2 hashing
* Diffie-Hellman (DH) groups:
** Phase1 DH groups 2, 14-18, 22, 23, 24
** Phase2 DH groups 2, 5, 14-18, 22, 23, 24

[NOTE]
The Anypoint VPN endpoint is the responder; IPsec connections should be established up and maintained up by initiating traffic from a remote device.

== Anypoint VPN Routing

The Anypoint VPN supports two types of routing:

* Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) routing: Your device uses BGP to dynamically advertise its routes to Anypoint VPN. We recommend using BGP routing if your device supports this protocol.
* Static routing: Requires you to specify the routes (subnets) for your network that should be accessible to Anypoint VPN.
